                <u>Domain Checking</u>
                <p>Every email sent to members of your organization is vetted upon being opened, displaying an indicator that varies in accordance with the email's safety, as shown below. This ensures that it's from a domain that your organization trusts (e.g. internal email domains or official noreply addresses), rather than a potentially fraudulent source.</p>

            <h2 class="aspys-section-title"><span class="emoji">üîê</span> Privacy & Security Statement</h2>
            <div class="aspys-text">

            <u>How secure are our storage methods?</u><br>
            <p>Very. Login credentials are salted and hashed using SHA-256, and direct server access requires an RSA key.<p>

            <u>What information is stored?</u><br>
            <p>We only store as much information as is absolutely necessary to bring Aspys to your staff. We store public information like the name of your organization and its domains, as well as staff reports of phishing, and the domains/emails your organization chooses to whitelist or blacklist. Nothing of compromising value is stored on our server. That is, unless your IT department likes to use the same password for everything. üòâ</p>
