					<p>If you've been redirected to this page, you've interacted with a Phishing Assessment email. The term <b>"phishing"</b> refers to a cyberattack in which someone tries to impersonate a reputable contact (e.g. Google Accounts, a District Officer, etc) in order to trick the target do something, such as clicking a link to download malware, or transferring money. While this was not an actual phishing email, it <i>was</i> a test by intended to size up the LCUSD staff's ability to detect and report such attacks.</p>

                <div class="block-title">How do I identify and respond to phishing emails?</div>
                <div class="block-content">
					<ol>
						<li><b><u>Check the email of the sender.</u></b> People within the district should sending emails within the LCUSD domain (lcusd.net or mylcusd.net). In the event that someone claiming to be a student of faculty member uses an outside email domain (e.g. gmail.com, hotmail.com), exercise caution!</li>
						<li>If you suspect something, <b><u>don't click on links or download attached files.</u></b> In order to check where a link directs, hover over links with your mouse cursor to see where they would lead you to.</li>
						<li><b><u>Report it.</u></b> Even if an email looks mostly legitimate but has a few discrepancies such as incorrect email address or uncharacteristic language, forward the email to help@lcusd.net to file a report.</li>
					</ol>

                <div class="block-title">Want to try practicing your identification skills?</div>
                <div class="block-content">
					<p>You're in luck! Google's got a little phishing quiz that you can use to practice identifying phishing emails. You can find the link <a href="https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/">here</a>. If you want, try hovering over the link to check its legitimacy. (Don't be <i>excessively</i> paranoid, phishingquiz.withgoogle.com is a legitimate address!)
