                  <p>If you've been redirected to this page, you've interacted with a Phishing Assessment email. The term <b>"phishing"</b> refers to a type of cyberattack in which someone tries to impersonate a reputable contact (e.g. Bank of America, a District Officer, etc) in order to trick the target do something, such as transferring money or clicking a link that downloads malware. While this was not an actual phishing email, it <i>was</i> a test by intended to size up LCUSD staff's preparedness to detect and report such attacks.</p>

                <div class="block-content">
					PLEASE DO NOT SHARE INFORMATION about this phishing assessment (and the emails it includes) with other staff members! In order for us to effectively gauge how prepared LCUSD is for potential phishing attacks, everyone needs to have a fair chance at experiencing the assessment's email scenario as realistically as possilble.

                <div class="block-content">
					<ol>
						<li><b><u>Check the email of the sender.</u></b> People within the district should sending emails within the LCUSD domain (lcusd.net or mylcusd.net). In the event that someone claiming to be a student of faculty member uses an outside email domain (e.g. gmail.com, hotmail.com), exercise caution!</li>
						<li>If you suspect something, <b><u>don't click on links or download attached files.</u></b> In order to check where a link directs, hover over links with your mouse cursor to see where they would lead you to.</li>
						<li><b><u>Report it.</u></b> Even if an email looks mostly legitimate but has a few discrepancies such as incorrect email address or uncharacteristic language, forward the email to help@lcusd.net to file a report.</li>

                <div class="block-content">
					<p>You're in luck! Google's got a little phishing quiz that you can use to practice identifying phishing emails. You can find the link <a href="https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/">here</a>. If you want, try hovering over the link to check its legitimacy. (Don't be <i>excessively</i> paranoid, phishingquiz.withgoogle.com is a legitimate address!)
