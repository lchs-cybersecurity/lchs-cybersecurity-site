					<p>We're a group of students who work in coordination with the District Tech Department to keep students and staff members safe from cyberattacks. In an age where public institutions such as schools, hospitals and businesses are increasingly becoming the targets of relentless cyberattacks, it's up to us to stay ahead of the curve and keep LCUSD secure.</p>

							<h3>Phishy</h3>
							<p>Phishy is a series of decoy "phishing" emails that are sent out in succession in order to assess how the staff of LCUSD would respond to phishing attacks. This allows us to more effectively allocate certain technologies and resources where we need to as well as personalize teacher training on a targeted, per-individual basis.</p>

							<h3>LCUSD Verifier</h3>
							<p>LCUSD Verifier is a web extension for the Chrome browser that checks whether a purported sender is from within LCUSD, saving the user extra steps in checking for a phishing attack. <u>NOTE: LCUSD Verifier is currently in development.</u></p>
